# RSS2Email

This project is a naive port of the [r2e](https://github.com/wking/rss2email) project to golang.


## Rationale

I prefer to keep my server(s) pretty minimal, and replacing `r2e` allowed me to remove a bunch of Python packages I otherwise had no need for:

      steve@ssh ~ $ sudo dpkg --purge rss2email
      Removing rss2email (1:3.9-2.1) ...

      ssh ~ # apt-get autoremove
      Reading package lists... Done
      Building dependency tree
      Reading state information... Done
      The following packages will be REMOVED:
       python-xdg python3-bs4 python3-chardet python3-feedparser python3-html2text
       python3-html5lib python3-lxml python3-six python3-webencodings
      0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 9 to remove and 0 not upgraded.

This project, being built in [golang](https://golang.org), is self-contained and easy to deploy without the need for additional external libraries.




# Installation

There are two ways to install this project from source, which depend on the version of the [go](https://golang.org/) version you're using.

If you prefer you can fetch a binary from [our release page](https://github.com/skx/rss2email/releases).  Currently there is only a binary for Linux (amd64) due to the use of `cgo` in our dependencies.

## Build without Go Modules (Go before 1.11)

    go get -u github.com/skx/rss2email

## Build with Go Modules (Go 1.11 or higher)

    git clone https://github.com/skx/rss2email ;# make sure to clone outside of GOPATH
    cd rss2email
    go install


# Configuration

Once you have a binary you'll need to configure the feeds to monitor. To add a new feed use the `add` sub-command:

     $ rss2email add https://example.com/blog.rss
     $ rss2email add https://example.net/index.rss
     $ rss2email add https://example.com/foo.rss

You can view the currently configured feeds via the `list` subcommand:

     $ rss2email list

Or delete a feed by specifying the item to remove:

     $ rss2email delete https://example.com/foo.rss

> **NOTE**: Feeds are stored in `~/.rss2email/feeds`, you might prefer to edit that directly.  Just add one URI per line.

Once you've added your feeds you should then add the binary to your `crontab`, to ensure it runs regularly to actually send you the emails. You should add something similar to this to your `crontab`:

     # Announce feed-changes via email every fifteen minutes
     */15 * * * * $HOME/go/bin/rss2email cron user@example.com

When new items appear in the feeds they will then be sent to you via email.

Each email will be multi-part, containing both `text/plain` and `text/html` versions of the new post(s).

If you run `rss2email help cron` you'll see that it is possible to customize the senders' email address, as well as a format-string used to construct the email `Subject:` header.  By default generated emails will use the following template-string, which matches that produced by the original `r2e` project:

* `[rss2email] #{ITEM.TITLE}`


## Initial Run

When you add a new feed all the items will initially be unseen/new, and this means you'll receive a flood of emails if you were to run:

     $ rss2email add https://blog.steve.fi/index.rss
     $ rss2email cron

To avoid this you can use the `-send=false` flag, which will merely record each item as having been seen, rather than sending you emails:

     $ rss2email add https://blog.steve.fi/index.rss
     $ rss2email cron -send=false


# Assumptions

There are a number of assumptions baked into this application:

* We assume that `/usr/sbin/sendmail` exists and will send email successfully.
* We assume the recipient and sender email addresses can be the same.
  * i.e. If you mail output to `bob@example.com` that will be used as the sender address.
  * But you can change that if you wish, via `-from`


# Github Setup

This repository is configured to run tests upon every commit, and when pull-requests are created/updated.  The testing is carried out via [.github/run-tests.sh](.github/run-tests.sh) which is used by the [github-action-tester](https://github.com/skx/github-action-tester) action.

Releases are automated in a similar fashion via [.github/build](.github/build), and the [github-action-publish-binaries](https://github.com/skx/github-action-publish-binaries) action.
